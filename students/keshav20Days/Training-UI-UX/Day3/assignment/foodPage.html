            <p class="">A burger is a quintessential American dish that has
                gained popularity worldwide. This iconic food item typically
                consists of a ground meat patty, often beef, cooked to perfection
                and placed between two slices of a soft bread roll known as a bun.
                However, the beauty of a burger lies in its versatility, as it can
                be customized with various toppings and condiments to suit individual
                preferences.
