You don't see them at first, but your car gets a signal from the other car that it's directly in your path and warns you of the potential collision, or even hits the brakes automatically to avoid an accident. A developing technology called Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication, or V2V,
             is being tested by automotive manufacturers like Ford as a way to help reduce the amount of accidents on the road.
             Twenty or so years down the line, Standage predicts that overall car ownership will return to its roots: wealthy people will be the ones that will want to bear the costs of car ownership.
             We are in the middle of the biggest revolution in motoring since Henry Ford's first production line started turning back in 1913.

             And it is likely to happen much more quickly than you imagine.
             
             Many industry observers believe we have already passed the tipping point where sales of electric vehicles (EVs) will very rapidly overwhelm petrol and diesel cars.</p>
